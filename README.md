# shiny-eGFR

As a former lifelong patient with chronic kidney disease, eGFR was the bane of my existence. But now, as a kidney transplant recipient, I decided to create a simple calculator in Shiny. This app allows you to calculate eGFR based on different parameters and offers the flexibility to fork and customize it to your specific needs. Unlike online calculators, this app can be used offline by downloading and running it in RStudio.
